"""
Prompts configuration for the code graph RAG system â€” Ultra-Strict Cypher output.

Goal: completely eliminate prose from the CypherGenerator by forcing a single, deterministic query shape.
This version:
- Hard-requires output to START WITH 'MATCH ' and contain NO OTHER TEXT.
- Provides ONE canonical consolidated query template to cover "purpose of <function>" and similar lookups.
- Mirrors the same contract for both remote and local cypher models.

You must not write to the DB. Only read with MATCH / OPTIONAL MATCH / RETURN / ORDER BY / LIMIT.

Return aliases for all fields.
